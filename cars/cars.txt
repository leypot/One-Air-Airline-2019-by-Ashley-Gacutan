McLaren Senna
	-Naming a car after one of the world's greatest racers, Ayrton Senna, is a bold move, but we think McLaren pulled it off. This car would make the man proud.

Aston Martin Vanquish
	-Aston Martin has many great car names in its recent history—Vantage, Virage, Vulcan—but Vanquish takes the cake. Just imagine being able to tell someone you drive a Vanquish.

Ferrari 812 Superfast
	-Ferrari brought back the Superfast name for its front-engine V12 flagship. With 789 hp on offer, it's appropriate.

Ford Mustang
	-There's something so evocative about the name "Mustang." It suits this car so perfectly.

Dodge Magnum
	-Magnum P.I.? Dirty Harry's .44 Magnum revolver? No matter what you associate it with, the word "magnum" is automatically cool.

2017 Mazda MX-5 Miata
	Everything we just said about picking a spacious and versatile car? Forget it—at least for the next minute or two. Young couples with no kids and a lot of freedom have an opportunity to make the most of it by sharing a 2-seat convertible for a few years. There’s enough room for some groceries, maybe a weekend’s worth of clothing if you’re willing to pack light. Yes, we admit there are some sacrifices to consider. But the Miata is fun and stylish, yet reliable and relatively inexpensive, which means it’s got some practical aspects, too. It’s a great way to enjoy your time together, as well as your youth, while it’s just the two of you.

2017 Honda HR-V
	Introduced just last year, the Honda HR-V is a basic but useful addition to the brand’s lineup of compact crossovers. The 2017 HR-V is bigger inside than it looks, with a comfortable cabin that easily accommodates five passengers and plenty of cargo. As is typical with the Honda brand, the HR-V comes with a carefully curated list of standard equipment, designed specifically to appeal to younger customers and to increase the vehicle’s value compared to competitors. We suggest that young couples budget a little more for an all-wheel-drive HR-V; while this Honda may not have the abilities of some true off-road vehicle vehicles, it’ll still reach some of those off-the-beaten-path spots.

2017 Audi A4
	-The 2017 Audi A4 is a bit more expensive than the other vehicleson this list of the 10 best cars for young couples… but we have our reasons. It’s pretty obvious that practicality is the theme that ties this all together, and for a small luxury car, the Audi A4 is about as practical as you can get. Like the other cars featured here, the A4 earns fantastic safety scores, and though it hasn’t yet been given a reliability rating from J.D. Power, last year’s version did well. With optional quattro all-wheel drive, the A4 is a capable commuter vehicle and fantastic weekend companion for young couples with a little extra cash to spend.
